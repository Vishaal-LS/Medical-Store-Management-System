Introduction:
The medical store management system is a software application developed in C++ that allows a medical store to manage an inventory of medicines. It provides functions to add medicines to the store, view available medicines, and sell medicines. This project aims to simplify the inventory management process of a medical store, improve efficiency, and ensure accurate stock management.

Project Scope:
The scope of the project includes the development of a medical store management system using C++.

The program allows the medical store to perform basic operations such as adding medicines to the inventory, viewing available medicines, and selling medicines. 

Hardware Requirements:
The hardware requirements for running the medical store management system are minimal and include a computer system with the following specifications:
•	Processor: Pentium 4 or higher
•	RAM: 1 GB or higher
•	Storage: 500 MB of free disk space or higher
•	Input devices: Keyboard and mouse

The software requirements for running the medical store management system are as follows:

Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS
C++ Compiler: GCC, MinGW, or Visual C++
IDE : Visual Studio, Code::blocks or any other IDE

Tools Used:
 The tools and technology used in the implementation of the project include:
•	C++ Programming language
•	IDE Visual Studio & Visual Studio Code
•	Version Control System of Git
•	MS Word for Documentation/Report 


Implementation Of Code:

The system consists of two classes: Medicine and MedicalStore.

The Medicine class represents a medicine with its name, manufacturer, price, and quantity, and provides methods to access and modify these attributes.
The MedicalStore class represents a medical store and provides methods to add medicines to the store, view available medicines, and sell medicines to customers.


Conclusion:
The medical store management project is a simple and efficient way to manage the inventory and sales of medicines in a medical store. The system provides functionalities to add medicines, view available medicines, and sell medicines to customers. It is implemented using C++ programming language and can be further enhanced with additional features such as billing, reporting, and user authentication to make it more comprehensive and practical for real-world medical stores.
Overall, the project serves as a useful tool for medical store owners or pharmacists to manage their inventory and sales effectively.
